= Food Composition Resolution (via Nutrient Mapping)

Food consumption data (typically originating from recall 24 interviews) is mapped to a food composition database, 
that provides (measured or estimated) chemical food component quantities for a given specific food.

In effect, consumed quantities of food X can be resolved to consumed quantities of nutrients A, B, C, etc..
