= Data Cleaning
:includedir: includes

Typically with surveys, data will be entered incorrectly by interviewers 
or issues with recipes are discovered only *after* interviews had been conducted.
Hence it is likely that respondent and consumption data will need correction as a post processing step.

_Dita_ implements an interview-set transformer, that corrects interview data based on uploaded correction files.
Those correction files have following structure:

== Respondent Correction

Allows to correct defect data entered during interview such as the _Respondent-Id_, _Sex_ or _Date of Birth_.
Also allows to remove interviews from respondents, that later wished to withdraw from the survey.

== Consumption Correction

=== Food

Correcting food consumptions, that have no identifier, only a name.

class FoodByNameCorr << (R,orchid) >> {

[source,yaml]
.Fixes food with missing identifier (having a name but no sid)
----
foodByName:
- name: "Maiswaffeln"
  sid: "at.gd/2.0:food/02423"
----

=== Composite

Correction of composite consumptions supports 3 basic changes:

* Renaming of the composite consumption entry 
* *ADD* Ingredient: 
** requires identifier (`sid`) of food to add
** requires `amountGrams` of food to add
** requires `facets` of food to add
* *DELETE* Ingredient: 
** requires identifier (_sid_) of food to remove

After those changes are applied, all the ingredient amounts are recalculated 
such that the composite's total amount consumed stays the same (as compared to before the correction).

@enduml
----

Consumption entries have no identifier per-se, so we use multiple *coordinates* to narrow down specific entries:

* `sid`: SemanticIdentifier of the recipe in question
* `respondentId`
* `interviewOrdinal`
* `mealHourOfDay`
* `source`: path of the interview source file in question

NOTE: Special care needs to be taken when uploading new interview data, 
as this may render those coordinates invalid. It may also render any of the above corrections invalid!

== Working with multiple Correction Files

Multiple correction files can be uploaded each representing a `Correction24` data structure. 
_Dita_ automatically collects these into a single `Correction24` object for interview data post processing.

Here are some templates:

[source,yaml]
.only correcting respondents
----
respondents:
- alias: "EB_9999"
  #...
# and so on ...
foodByName: []
composites: []
----

[source,yaml]
.only correcting composite consumptions
----
