= Globodiet

We provide a metamodel for the 70+ tables of the _Globodiet Parameter Database_ from which 
Java source code can be (auto-)generated,
that has all the corresponding entities to be managed by the _Parameter Data Management (UI)_ application.

== Parameter Data Management (UI)

Application to manage the _Globodiet Parameter Model_ is provided under

[source]
----
globodiet/manager/
----

This builds and saves your _Docker_ image to `target/jib-image.tar`

[source]
----
cd globodiet/manager
mvn compile jib:buildTar
----
 
which you can load into docker with:

[source]
----
docker load --input target/jib-image.tar
----

For the application to run, 
it needs a blob store for the various versions of the 
Parameter Model, which is realized on the local file system of the host:

[source]
.Environment Variable
----
dita.blobstore.root=<path-to-blob-store>
