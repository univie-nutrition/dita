        Rule: Facet (facet_code) will be displayed only if descriptor in facdesc 
        is previously selected by the subject according or not to a food classification (group/subgroup1/subgroup2). 
        - When a group/subgroup1/subgroup2 is specified, the rule is applied only for these 3 levels of classification (e.g. 070101 only for foods from beef classification).
        - When a group/subgroup1 is specified, the rule is applied for all the foods attached to these 2 or 3 levels of classification (e.g. 0701 so for foods classified under 070100, 070101, 070102, 070103, 070104, 070105 & 070106).
        - When a group is specified, the rule is applied for all the foods attached to these 1, 2 or 3 levels of classification (e.g. 06 so for foods classified under 0601, 0602, 0603, 0604, 0605,  0606 and also for 060300, 060301 & 060302).
        - When the group/subgroup1/subgroup2 is not specified (null values), the rule is applied to all foods, whatever its classification.
