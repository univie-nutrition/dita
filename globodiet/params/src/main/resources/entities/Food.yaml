        Type of item: 
          (none) -> Normal Food Item
          GI -> Generic Food Item 
          SH -> Shadow Item 
          CR -> Composed Recipe (On-the-fly Recipe)
                Definition: its different ingredients can be identified and 
                quantified separately after preparation 
                (e.g. meat balls in sauce, rice with sauce, couscous dish, mixed salad) 
                or just before mixing (e.g. coffee with milk).
                Composed recipes are built during the interview: there is no a priori list of composed recipes. 
                They are made from items listed below/linked to a quick list item.
                Example: Salad 
                - Lettuce 
                - Tomato 
                - Cucumber 
                - Salad dressing (can be a recipe in some projects where all sauces are in recipes)
